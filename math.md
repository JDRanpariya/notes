## There are two main branches of statistics
- Descriptive statistics
  > In
descriptive statistics, it deals with collection of data, its
presentation in various forms, such as tables, graphs and
diagrams and findings averages and other measures which
would describe the data
- Inferential statistics
  > In
inferential statistics, it deals with techniques used for
analysis of data, making the estimates and drawing
conclusions from limited information taken on sample
basis and testing the reliability of the estimates.

## Limitations of Statistics
  - Statistics does not study individuals
  - Statistical laws(Physical Laws) are not exact
  - Statistics table may be misused
  - Statistical cannot be applied to heterogeneous data
  - Only a person who has an expert knowledge of statistics can
handle statistical data efficiently.
  - Some errors are possible in statistical decisions. Particularly
the inferential statistics involves certain errors. We do not
know whether an error has been committed or not.

## Categories of Data
 - Primary Data
   > Primary data is the one, which is collected
by the investigator himself for the purpose of a specific
inquiry or study. Such data is original in character and is
generated by survey conducted by individuals or research
institution or any organization.
   ### Can be collected through
       - Personal Investigaion
       - Investigation
       - Questionnair
       - Telephone
 - Secondery Data
   > Data: The secondary data are the second hand
information which are already collected by some one
(organization) for some purpose and are available for the
present study. The secondary data are not pure in
character and have undergone some treatment at least
once.
    ### Can be collected through
       - Published Sources ( Reports & official Publicatoins )
       - Unpublished Sources ( Research Institutes, studies, scholars etc. )
 ## Types of Classification
   - Geographical classification
   - Chronological classification
   - Qualitative classification
   - Quantitative classification
   
 ## Types of Diagram
   - 1D
     - Line Diagram
     - Simple Diagram
     - Multiple Bar Diagram
     - Sub divided Bar Diagram
     - Percentage Bar Diagram
   - 2D 
     - Rectangles
     - Squares
     - Pie Diagram or Circle
   - 3D
   - Pictograms & Cartograms
 ## Graphs
   - Histogram 
   - Frequency Polygon
   - Frequency Curves
